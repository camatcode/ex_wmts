Thanks for wanting to help!

The documentation for the project can be made using `mix docs` or by visiting [Hex](https://hexdocs.pm/ex_wmts/)

Contributions should have working tests, be formatted (`mix format`) and pass credo (`mix credo --strict`)

Any issues? Contact the maintainer, he's happy to help
